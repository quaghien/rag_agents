# Agent Knowledge and Applications

Agents are autonomous software entities capable of perceiving their environment, processing information, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. In artificial intelligence, agents play a key role in building intelligent systems that can interact, plan, respond, and collaborate with other agents or humans.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The USB-C port equivalent for agentic systems.

<img src="images/mcp_contain.png" width="60%" alt="model">

<img src="images/json-rpc.png" width="50%" alt="model">

Transport Mechanisms:

stdio: Communication over standard input/output streams

- The client and server receive JSON messages via stdin and respond via stdout

- Simplifies local process integration and debugging

- Well-suited for local servers like File, Git server, etc.

<img src="images/stdio.png" width="60%" alt="model">

HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE):

- Establishes a bidirectional communication pattern over HTTP

- The server maintains an SSE connection for pushing messages to clients

- Clients send commands via standard HTTP POST requests

- Enables distributed architecture with multiple concurrent clients

- Better suited for hosted servers.

## Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol

- MCP provides agents with access to tools.

- While A2A allows agents to connect with other agents and collaborate in teams.

<img src="images/a2a.png" width="60%" alt="model">

The A2A protocol is built upon established web standards, primarily using JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S) for request/response interactions and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming.

- A2A-supporting Remote Agents must publish a "JSON Agent Card" detailing their capabilities and authentication.

- Clients use this to find and communicate with the best agent for a task.

<img src="images/a_card.png" width="50%" alt="model">

Example `JSON Agent Card` Structure:
```
{
  "name": "Image Generation Agent",
  "description": "Generates images based on text prompts.",
  "url": "https://api.example-image-agent.com/a2a",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": {
    "streaming": true,
    "pushNotifications": false,
    "stateTransitionHistory": true
  },
  "authentication": {
    "schemes": ["apiKey"]
  },
  "defaultInputModes": ["text"],
  "defaultOutputModes": ["image/png"],
  "skills": [
    {
      "id": "generate_image",
      "name": "Generate Image",
      "description": "Creates an image from a textual description.",
      "inputModes": ["text"],
      "outputModes": ["image/png"],
      "examples": ["Generate an image of a 'blue cat wearing a top hat'"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)

Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is a more generalized framework for managing structured dialogue between agents. Think of it as the broad umbrella under which other protocols like A2A may reside.

<img src="images/acp.png" width="70%" alt="model">

Key Features of ACP:  

- Message Standardization: Uses speech-act theory (e.g., INFORM, QUERY, REQUEST) to standardize communication.
- Ontology Support: Agents share a common vocabulary, reducing ambiguity.
- Error Handling: Includes robust exception management and message validation.
- Agent Registry Services: Agents can register capabilities and discover others through directory facilitators.

ACP is widely used in environments with heterogeneous AI systems, often orchestrated by an AI agents development company to build scalable, distributed platforms where different agents (like recommendation engines, fraud detectors, and monitoring bots) coexist and collaborate.

Choosing the Right Protocol for Your AI Stack  
When building or scaling an AI agents communication architecture, your choice among MCP, A2A, and ACP depends on your specific needs:

- Choose MCP if your AI agents rely heavily on context, history, and personalized interactions. Ideal for recommendation systems, personalized assistants, or healthcare AI agents.
- Choose A2A for environments requiring distributed decision-making or multi-agent coordination. Best for supply chains, financial systems, or robotic swarms.
- Choose ACP when you need a common language and messaging standard across a wide range of agents, particularly in complex enterprise environments.

For example, a smart hospital system might use MCP for patient context sharing, A2A for real-time coordination between diagnostic bots, and ACP as the overarching communication framework.

### 9. Retrieval Techniques

- Keyword Matching (Sparse Vector Search): Uses lexical matching with TF-IDF, BM25.

- Dense Vector Search: Employs transformer-based embeddings for semantic similarity via Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search in dense vector spaces.

- Hybrid Retrieval: Combines sparse (BM25) and dense (embedding) retrieval to balance precision and recall, enhancing relevance and robustness.

| Feature               | Sparse Vectors                                    | Dense Vectors                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Data Representation   | Majority of elements are zero                     | All elements are non-zero                          |
| Computational Efficiency | Generally higher, especially in operations involving zero elements | Lower, as operations are performed on all elements |
| Information Density   | Less dense, focuses on key features               | Highly dense, capturing nuanced relationships     |
| Example Applications  | Text search, Hybrid search                         | RAG, many general machine learning tasks          |

Mixing or fusion

You can mix the results from both dense and sparse vectors, based purely on their relative scores. This is a simple and effective approach, but it doesnâ€™t take into account the semantic similarity between the results. Among the popular mixing methods are:

- Reciprocal Ranked Fusion (RRF)
- Relative Score Fusion (RSF)
- Distribution-Based Score Fusion (DBSF)

### 10. Cross-encoder and Bi-encoder

Cross-Encoder is a deep learning model that jointly encodes both the query and document to directly assess their relevance by capturing fine-grained interactions between them.

Itâ€™s commonly used for re-ranking because:

- It provides higher accuracy by modeling detailed query-document interactions.

- Itâ€™s computationally expensive, so itâ€™s applied to a small set of retrieved candidates.

- It improves final result quality by filtering out less relevant items.

<img src="images/cross.png" width="60%" alt="model">

Bi-Encoder independently encodes the query and document into separate embeddings, then measures relevance using similarity metrics like cosine similarity.

Itâ€™s often used for initial retrieval because:

- It enables efficient large-scale search by precomputing document embeddings.

- It allows fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search.

- Itâ€™s less accurate than cross-encoder but much faster, suitable for filtering large collections before re-ranking.
